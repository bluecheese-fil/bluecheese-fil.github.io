      <h3> First exercise </h3>
      <a>
        The shape of the distributions will depend on the values chosen for N, M and P. When both M and N are large, but P is small, the distribution will tend to resemble a normal distribution.
        The histograms will look like a normal distribution when M is large. If N is increased, the histograms will contain more details for a given point, showing different variations on the graph.
        If M is small, the histogram graph will tend to look more uniform, so that each columns size is described by the same charateristics.
        Below are some images that show this behaviour.

      <h3> Second exercise </h3>
      Recall briefly the definition and math notions relevant to "probability space" and make some simple examples, indicating among the triple of the space the meaning of each element in your particular example.
      If you wanted to model probabilistically the homework Exercise 1, explain what are the 3 sets of your probability space and their elements, in this case.
