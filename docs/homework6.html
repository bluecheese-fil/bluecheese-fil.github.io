      <h1> Gambler's Ruin Problem </h1>
      <br>
      <a>
        Gambler's Ruin Problem is a classic problem in probability theory. In this famous scenario, a gambler starts with an initial amount of <b> i </b> dollars. On each game, the gambler wins 1$ with probability <b> p </b> and loses
        1$ with probability <b> <div class="latex"> q = p - 1 </div> </b>. We have to keep in mind that both p and q are probability numbers, therefore must be defined as bigger or equals than 0 and smaller or equals than 1. The gambler will
        stop playing once he has lost all his money, or has accumulated <b> N </b> dollars with his wins. This problem's question aims to find the probability that the gambler will end up with N dollars.
