      <h1> Gambler's Ruin Problem </h1>
      <br>
      <a>
        Gambler's Ruin Problem is a classic problem in probability theory. In this famous scenario, a gambler starts with an initial amount of <b> i </b> dollars. On each game, the gambler wins 1$ with probability <b> p </b> and loses
        1$ with probability <b> q = p - 1 </b>. We have to keep in mind that both p and q are probability numbers, therefore must be defined as bigger or equals than 0 and smaller or equals than 1. The gambler will
        stop playing once he has lost all his money, or has accumulated <b> N </b> dollars with his wins. This problem's question aims to find the probability that the gambler will end up with N dollars.
        <br>
        Let's being with a fair game, where p is one half. Considering X(t) to be the amount of dollars the gamblers has, we expect the dollars on the next round to be:
        <div class="latex"> E[X(t+1)] = \frac{1}{2}(E[X(t)] - 1) + \frac{1}{2}(E[X(t)] + 1) </div>
        Hence when it is a fair game, the probability that the gambler walks out of the casino with N dollars is:  <div class="latex"> \frac{i}{N} </div> In reality, the games in casino are usually unfair.

      Here is an example from the current homework, where given p the number can go up or down by 1. We then calculate how many items reached a particular element and show them through an histogram
