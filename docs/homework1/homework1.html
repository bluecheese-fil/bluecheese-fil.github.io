      <h1> What is statistics? </h1>
      <a>
        "Statistics is the science concerned with developing and
        studying methods for collecting, analyzingm interpreting and presenting empirical data" (1).
        This field's primary objective is to gain insights from data and focuses on various subjects such as data collection, description and analysis (2).
        The responsibilities of a statistician can range from examining predetermined sample to studying effective wasy to collect data.

      <h2> What are the interdisciplinary connections and relationships of statistics, with a focus on its relevance to cybersecurity? </h1>
      <a>
        Statistics is a highly interdisciplinary field; research in statistics finds applicability in virtually all scientific fields (1).
        Its utility lies in its ability to mathematically and probabilistically describe a wide range of real-world scenarios.
        Various disciplines use statistics in diverse ways, such as medicine and psychology to assess treatment efficacy,
        and economic studies employing it for predictive purposes, particularly in relation to the stock market.
        In the realm of cybersecurity, statistics offers various uses. One notable application involves the use of
        statistical models to detect anomalies in network behavior. Through the assignment of anomaly scores,
        this defensive approach can identify malicious entities, including software or attackers,
        enhancing user protection against zero-day exploits (3).
        An example of statistical cybersecurity is the existence of a dedicated group at Imperial College in London.
        This group specializes in developing data science techniques for identifying intrusions within large networks.
        Statistical techniques which have been so far been deployed include classification, data mining, penalised regression analysis, machine learning and more (4).

      <h1> What are the definitions and distinctions between the concepts of attribute, variable, population, sample, and dataset? </h1>
      <a>
        In the realm of statistics, a population refers to a group of all individuals that meet a set of specification. A sample is a subset of a population, created by extracing population units using different sampling techniques.
        The importance of the correctness of sampling techniques relies on the need to create a rapresetative sample group,
        where it's possible to collect valuable data and exctract information valid for the entire population.
        Through surveys and polls, specific population segments provide responses, known as <b> attributes </b>,
        to particular questions or <b> variables </b>. A dataset is a collection of data, where each row rapresents an individual and each column rapresents a measured variable
        measured. intersection of these rows and columns equals to the attribute, that is the individual's response.

      <h1> Write a brief explanation of sampling techniques </h1>
      <a>
      The way in which a sample of individuals is extrancted from a population is crucial, since it will determine the population
      to which it will be possible to generalize any research. The procedure used to pick population units will determin whether a
      bias exists in the chosen group. (1) As in Qualtrics summary article (2), we consider two main sampling methods:
      <ul>
        <li> Probability sampling </li>
        <li> Non-probability sampling </li>
      </ul>

      Probability sampling, also known as random sampling, is a kind of sample where the individuals that will compose the sample
      are chosen randomly. Non-probability sampling, on the other hand, is a technique where researchers deliberately picks items or individuals based
      on their research goal.
      Some of the most known probability sampling techniques are: <br>
      <b> Simple random sampling </b>, where every element in the population has an equal chance of being chosen. This is very easy, cheap and removes all possible bias that could be introduced.
      However, it might lead to unrepresentative groupings being picked by chance. <br>
      <b> Systematic sampling</b>: This technique the random selection is only applied to the first item chosen. A rule then applies where every nth item is picked. The interval can be changed by
      the researchers.<br>
      <b> Stratified sampling </b> involves creating random selection among predefined groups. This is mostly useful when something about the target population is known and we want to introduce randomness.
      This however can lead to problems since an error in the stratification could introduce bias. <br>

      Non-probability sampling methods
      The non-probability sampling methodology doesn’t offer the same bias-removal benefits as probability sampling, but there are times when these types of sampling are chosen for expediency or simplicity. Here are some forms of non-probability sampling and how they work.
      1. Convenience sampling
      People or elements in a sample are selected on the basis of their accessibility and availability. If you are doing a research survey and you work at a university, for example, a convenience sample might consist of students or co-workers who happen to be on campus with open schedules who are willing to take your questionnaire.
      This kind of sample can have value, especially if it’s done as an early or preliminary step, but significant bias will be introduced.
      2. Quota sampling
      Like the probability-based stratified sampling method, this approach aims to achieve a spread across the target population by specifying who should be recruited for a survey according to certain groups or criteria. For example, your quota might include a certain number of males and a certain number of females. Alternatively, you might want your samples to be at a specific income level or in certain age brackets or ethnic groups.
      Bias may be introduced during the selection itself – for example, volunteer bias might skew the sample towards people with free time who are interested in taking part. Or bias may be part and parcel of the way categories for the quotas are selected by researchers.
      3. Purposive sampling
      Participants for the sample are chosen consciously by researchers based on their knowledge and understanding of the research question at hand or their goals. Also known as judgment sampling, this technique is unlikely to result in a representative sample, but it is a quick and fairly easy way to get a range of results or responses.
      4. Snowball or referral sampling
      With this approach, people recruited to be part of a sample are asked to invite those they know to take part, who are then asked to invite their friends and family and so on. The participation radiates through a community of connected individuals like a snowball rolling downhill.
      This method can be helpful when the researcher doesn’t know very much about the target population and has no easy way to contact or access them. However it will introduce bias, for example by missing out isolated members of a community or skewing towards certain age or interest groups who recruit amongst themselves.
