      <h1> What is statistics? </h1>
      <a>
        "Statistics is the science concerned with developing and
        studying methods for collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting empirical data" (1).
        This field's primary objective is to gain insights from data and focuses on various subjects such as data collection, description and analysis (2).
        The responsibilities of a statistician can range from examining a predetermined sample to studying effective ways to collect data.

      <h2> What are the interdisciplinary connections and relationships of statistics, with a focus on its relevance to cybersecurity? </h1>
      <a>
        Statistics is a highly interdisciplinary field; research in statistics finds applicability in virtually all scientific fields (1).
        Its utility lies in its ability to mathematically and probabilistically describe a wide range of real-world scenarios.
        Various disciplines use statistics in diverse ways, such as medicine and psychology to assess treatment efficacy,
        and economic studies employing it for predictive purposes, particularly in relation to the stock market.
        In the realm of cybersecurity, statistics offers various uses. One notable application involves the use of
        statistical models to detect anomalies in network behavior. Through the assignment of anomaly scores,
        this defensive approach can identify malicious entities, including software or attackers,
        enhancing user protection against zero-day exploits (3).
        An example of statistical cybersecurity is the existence of a dedicated group at Imperial College in London.
        This group specializes in developing data science techniques for identifying intrusions within large networks.
        Statistical techniques that have been deployed so far include classification, data mining, penalised regression analysis, machine learning and more (4).

      <h1> What are the definitions and distinctions between the concepts of attribute, variable, population, sample, and dataset? </h1>
      <a>
        In the realm of statistics, a population refers to a group of all individuals that meet a set of specifications. A sample is a subset of a population, created by extracting population units using different sampling techniques.
        The importance of the correctness of sampling techniques relies on the need to create a representative sample group,
        where it's possible to collect valuable data and exctract information valid for the entire population.
        Through surveys and polls, specific population segments provide responses, known as <b> attributes </b>,
        to particular questions or <b> variables </b>. A dataset is a collection of data, where each row rapresents an
        individual and each column rapresents a measured variable. An intersection of these rows and columns corresponds the attribute, which is the individual's response.

      <h1> Write a brief explanation of sampling techniques </h1>
      <a>
      The way in which a sample of individuals is extracted from a population is crucial, since it will determine the population
      to which it will be possible to generalize any research. The procedure used to pick population units will determine whether a
      bias exists in the chosen group. (1) As in Qualtrics summary article (2), we consider two main sampling methods:
      <ul>
        <li> Probability sampling </li>
        <li> Non-probability sampling </li>
      </ul>

      Probability sampling, also known as random sampling, is a kind of sample where the individuals that will compose the sample
      are chosen randomly. Non-probability sampling, on the other hand, is a technique where researchers deliberately picks items or individuals based
      on their research goal.
      Some of the most known probability sampling techniques are: <br>
      <b> Simple random sampling </b>, where every element in the population has an equal chance of being chosen. This is very easy, cheap and removes all possible bias that could be introduced.
      However, it might lead to unrepresentative groupings being picked by chance. <br>
      <b> Systematic sampling</b>: This technique the random selection is only applied to the first item chosen. A rule then applies where every nth item is picked. The interval can be changed by
      the researchers.<br>
      <b> Stratified sampling </b> involves creating random selection among predefined groups. This is mostly useful when something about the target population is known and we want to introduce randomness.
      This however can lead to problems since an error in the stratification could introduce bias. <br>
      <br>
      Non-probability sampling methods don't affer the same bias-removal benefits but there are times when these types of sampling are chosen for expediency or simplicity.
      Some non-probability sampling are: <br>
      <b>Convenience sampling</b>, that consists on picking elements based on their accessibility and availability. This kind of sample
      is very useful, especially in early stages of a research, but it introduces considerable bias.
      <br>
      <b>Snowball</b> or <b>referral sampling</b> is used a lot today, especially in medical and psychologcial reserach. Here people
      are asked to invite others. This approach can be helpful when a researchers don't know much about their target population but it
      introduces bias. For example this is very ineffective in reaching isolated groups of individual or it oftes skew towards a certain age.
