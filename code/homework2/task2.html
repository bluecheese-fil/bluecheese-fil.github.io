    <h2> Task 2 - Data Structures </h2>

    <a> This task required to create different data structures and use this both in Javascript and C#. </a>
    <h2> JavaScript </h2>
    <a> This is the Javascript version, in particular we have: </a>

    <div class="divs" id="javascript">
      <a> Here are the Javascript function to use with a list: </a>
      <image class="img" src="/src/hw2/js_list.png"> </image>
      <a> Here are the Javascript function usable for a dictionary</a>
      <image class="img" src="/src/hw2/js_dict.png"> </image>
      <a>
        Here is the custom class that implements a Queue. This is done by creating a list of elements. The only allowed
        operations are adding an element, which is added last to the list, and removing an element, which is the first
        item of the list, following the <b> FIFO </b> rules. I've also implemented an "<b> include </b>" function, which checks for the items existance
      </a>
      <image class="img" src="/src/hw2/js_queue.png"> </image>
      <a>
        Here is the set class. With the functions in the pictures it's possible to add, remove and check an element's existance.
        Note that an Hashset is just a particular implementation of a Set. There are in fact different ways to create a Set, such as with a
        TreeSet, HashSet or a list, as I've done in the OrdereSet below.
      </a>
      <image class="img" src="/src/hw2/js_set.png"> </image>
      <a>
        This is the my class that implements an ordered set. It is simply done by using a list and sorting the items once they are added. Note that
        I only add an element if it's not already present in the list. This is because a set, by definition, is a collection of unique elements.
      </a>
      <image class="img" src="/src/hw2/js_orderedset.png"> </image>
      <a>
        Down here is a sorted list class I've created. This simply creates a list and calls the <b> sort </b> function on the list. Note that whenever I remove
        an element, the list is still sorted and the <b> sort </b> function doesn't need to be called again.
      </a>
      <image class="img" src="/src/hw2/js_sortedlist.png"> </image>
      <a>
        In the following image there is my class which implements a stack. This follows the <b> LIFO </b> rules,
        where the first item to be removed from the auxiliary list is the last element added.
      </a>

    </div>

    <a> Here is the <a href="https://github.com/bluecheese-fil/bluecheese-fil.github.io/"> file </a> that contains each created collection of data in JS</a>

    <h2> C# </h2>
    <a>
      Down here are the images that implements the same classes and functions in C#. Note that all classes were already
      precreated in C# and I didn't need to write any new class.
    </a>

    <div class="divs" id="csharp">
      <image class="img" src="/src/hw2/cs_dict.png"> </image>
