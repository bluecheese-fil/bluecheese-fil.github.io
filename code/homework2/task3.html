    <h2> Task 3 - Uniform distribution </h2>

    <p>
      This task required to generate N random numbers following a uniform distribution.
      With the Random class, I've created a unfirom variable between 0 and 100. After dividing in intervals, I've graphed the groups.
      The following image is the Javascript code that has been written to do so:
    </p>

    <image> </image> <!-- Javascript iamge -->
    <div class="outerclass">
      <iframe id="javascriptsim" src="./JavaScript/nUniform/nUniform.html" scrolling="no"> </iframe>
    </div>

    <p> Here is a sample graph resulted from the JavaScript code: </p>

    <p> 
      The resulting graph shows how random generation has equal likeliness to fall into one of the 'k' groups. This means that, on avarage, each group will have the same number of items.
      This is mostly notable when we choose a large n. In those cases, the graphs will get compress by division to make them fit the canvaas. As we can see, the difference between the columns
      shrinks.
