This webpage will contain a list of statistics homeworks index:\
Any theory webpages are contained in the Github /docs folder\
Any written homework, both JavaScript and C#, will be contained in the Github /code folder.

# Statistic's homework n.1

The webpages for this homework are: 

* [theory](/docs/homework1)
* [applications](/code/homework1/application)
The files that contain this homework applications are located in: /code/homework1.

It's possible to look at the entire source code on Github:
* [drawings.html](https://github.com/bluecheese-fil/bluecheese-fil.github.io/blob/main/code/homework1/drawings.html)
* [C# folder](https://github.com/bluecheese-fil/bluecheese-fil.github.io/tree/main/code/homework1/CSharp/Drawing), containing the C# entire project and the .exe build

**(13/10 note ): The C# project has been fixed, using a Bitmap as instructed. The code is now visible in the application webpage too. Screenshots have been used for this purpose.

# Statistic's homework n.2
