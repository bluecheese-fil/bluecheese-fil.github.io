      <h1> The CLT meaning, proof and simulations </h1>
      <a>
        The <b> Central Limit Theorem </b> (CLT) is a theorem that describes the properties of a sample mean, with a large enough sample.
        In particular it states that, by taking a sufficiently large sample from a population, it's means will be normally distributed,
        even if the population isn't normally distributed.
        We can describe the normal distribution by the paramters of the distribution of the population. In particular, the mean of the sampling
        distirbution is the mean of the population: \( \mu_{\overline{x}} = \mu \). On the other hand, the standard deviation of the sampling
        distirbution is the standard deviation of the population divided by the square root of the sample size: \( \sigma_{\overline{x}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \).
        We can now describe the normal function on those variables:
        $$ \overline{X} \sim N(\mu, \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}) $$
        We can look for this behaviour with the following example, created in exercise. The distribution drawn below follows a Poisson process, as we can see from the image
        on the left. However, with a large enough sample, we can see the typical bell curve of the normal distribution. This is consequence of the central limit theorem (image on the right).

        <h4> Proof: </h4>
        Let's now consider the proof for CLT.

        <!-- Continue with proof for CTL -->
        Let's consider \( X_1 \), \( X_2 \) to \( X_n \), an infinite number of identically distributed random variables, that have all the same
        expected value.
        The average is \( \overline{X_n} = \frac{1}{2} * \sum_{1}^{n}X_n \). Then, by the weak law, it must be true that
        $$ \overline{X_n} \to E[X_1] = E[X_2] = ... \ for \ n\to+\infty $$
        Let's consider the Chebyshev's inequality proof, by considering a finite variance. Since all items are indipentent, then the variance of \( X_n \) must be
        $$ Var(\overline{X_n}) = Var(\frac{1}{n}(X_1 + ... + X_n)) = \frac{1}{n^2} Var(X_1 + ... + X_n) = \frac{n \sigma^2}{n^2} = \frac{\sigma^2}{n} $$
        Using Chebyshev's inequality on \( \overline{X_n} \) we get:
        $$ P(|\overline{X_n} - \mu| < \epsilon) = 1 - P(|\overline{X_n} - \mu| \ge \epsilon) \ge 1 - \frac{\sigma^2}{n \epsilon^2} $$
        As n approaches infinity, the expression approaches 1. Therefore, we have proved that, by increasing the number of variables, the average will equals the expected value.
