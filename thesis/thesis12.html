      <h1> Ito Integration and Calculus, Concept and Didactical Simulations </h1>
      <p>
        Itô calculus, named after <b>Kiyosi Itô</b>, extends the methods of calculus to stochastic processes such as Brownian motion (or Wiener process),
        discussed in the <a href="/thesis/thesis10.html">tenth thesis</a>.
        This part of calculus has important applications in stochastic differential equations (SDE), discussed in the <a href="/thesis/thesis8.html">eighth thesis</a>,
        and in mathematical finance.
        The central concept is that the Itô stochastic integral is based on a generalization of the <b>Reimann-Stieltjes integral</b>, especially important in analysis.
        The integrands and the integrators are now stochastic processes:
        $$ Y_t = \int^t_0 H_s \ dX_s $$
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li> \( H \) is a locally square-integrable process </li>
        <li> \( X \) is a Brownian motion </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Here, \( H \) is generated and adapted to the filtration generated by \( X \). Concretely, the integral from \( 0 \) to \( t \) is a random variable,
        defined as a limit of a certain sequence of random variables; its evaluation requires considering a limit of a sequence of random variable.
        Given that the Brownian motion fails to satisfy the requirements to apply standard techniques of calculus, the Itô stochastic integral amounts to an
        integral with respect to a function which is not differentiable at any point. Key results of Itô calculus include the integration by parts formula and
        Itô's lemma, which is a change of variables formula. These formulas differ from those in standard calculus due to quadratic variation terms.
        Itô integral can also be defined as a limit in probability: we suppose the existance of a Wiener process \( B \), that \( H \) is right-continuous, adapted
        and locally bounded process. We also consider a sequence of <b>partitions</b> of \( [0, t] \) with mesh going to zero. The integral is the following:
        $$ \int^t_0 H dB = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{[t_{i-1}, t_i] \in \pi_n} H_{t_{i-1}} (B_{t_i} - B_{t_{i-1}}) $$
        Itô theorem has various applications; one example is based on the mathematical finance to calculate the payoff of a continuous trading strategy,
        conditioned by an adaptation factor to ensure that the strategy uses all the available information.

        In the previous image its shown the Itô integral with the <a style="color:blue">blue</a> line and a
        Brownian motion with the <a style="color: red;">red</a> line. In particular, both the integral and integrator
        are Brownian.
      </p>

      <h3> Properties of the Itô integral </h3>
      <p>
        For the Itô integral we consider five properties:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li> <b>Linearity</b>: \( I_t (aV + bU) = aI_t(V) + bI_t(U) \), </li>
        <li> <b>Continuity</b>: \( t \to I_t(v) \) is continuous, </li>
        <li> <b>Measurability</b>: \( I_t(v) \) is adaoted to \( X \), </li>
        <li> <b>Zero mean</b>: \( E[ \int^t_0 H_s dX_s] = 0 \), </li>
        <li> <b>Itô isometry</b>: \( E[ (\int^t_0 H_s dX_s)^2] = E[ \int^t_0 H^2_s ds] \), </li>
      </ol>
      <h3> Itô lemma </h3>
      <p>
        Itô lemma is a particular version of the <b>chain rule</b> formula, which applies to the Itô integral. It's one of the most frequently and powerful
        theorems in stochastic calculus. In particular, for a continuous n-dimensional semimartingales \( X = (X^1, ..., X^n) \) and twice continuously
        differentiable function f from \( \mathbb{R}^n \) to \( \mathbb{R} \). We consider:
        $$ df(X_t) = \sum^n_{i = 1} f_i (X_t) dX^i_t + \frac{1}{2} \sum^n_{i, j=1} f_{i,j} (X_t) d[X^i, X^j]_t $$
        This, as the integrations by parts, differes from the standard chain rules used in calculus due to the term of <b>quadratic covariation</b> \( [X^i, X^j] \).
        The formula can be generalized to include an explicit time-dependence in \( f \).
      </p>
      <h3> Integration by parts </h3>
      <p>
        Integration by parts is an important result in stochastic calculus: the integraion formula for the Itô integral differs from the standard due to the inclusion
        of a <b>quadratic covariation</b> tem. This must be considered since the Itô calculus deals with processes that have non-zero quadratic covariation, such as 
        the Brownian motion. Considering \( X \) and \( Y \) as semimartingales, then:
        $$ X_t Y_t = X_0 Y_0 + \int^t_0 X_{s-} \ dY_s + \int^t_0 Y_{s-} \ dX_s + [X, Y]_t $$
        where \( [X, Y] \) is the quadratic covariation process.
