        The <b> Law of Large Numbers </b> (LLN) is a theorem that describes the result of performing an experiment
        a large number of times. In particular, the average of the results obtained from the experiments is close to
        the expected value. This means that, by using indipentent and identically distributed random variables,
        the law of large numbers assures that the end result will be asintotically equals to the expected value.
        This is largely used everyday, especially by casinos. By assuring that the expected value of the gambiling machines
        give the casino revenue, it becomes a sustainable buisness model with large enough number of bets. Even if the casino
        might lose money from time to time, in the end it will gain money according to the expected value.
        We can see how a Bernoulli series converges to the theoretical probability, according to LLN. In particular,
        for a Bernoulli random variable, the expected value is the theoretical probability of success, and the average of the n variables, assuming them indipentent and identically distributed, as stated above.
        In this case, the expected value equals the relative frequency.
        <h4> Example: </h4>
        A fair toin coss is a Bernoulli trial, where the set of possible outcomes {H, T} can be mapped on the set of Bernoulli results {0, 1}. By being fair, the probability
        is the same for each outcome, therefore both Head and Tails have a 1/2 (0.5) chance of happening. According to the law of large numbers, the number of heads will be half the total trials.
        In particular, if we toss the coin n times, the number of heads will be one over 2n.

        There are two different versions of the law of large numbers. They are called <b> strong law of large numbers </b> and
        <b> weak law of large numbers </b>.

        <h2> Weak LLN </h2>
        The weak law of large numbers (also known as <b> Khinchin's law </b>) states that the sample average converges
        in probability towards the expected value. In particular:
      </a>
      <div class="latex"> \lim_{n\to+\infty}Pr(|\overline{X_{n}} - \mu < \varepsilon|) = 1 </div>
      <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">

      </div>
      <a>
        Let's now look at the proof:
        <h4> WLLN proof </h4>
        <!-- Add proof -->
        We start by defying the mean
        <h2> Strong LLN </h2>
        The <b> strong law </b> states that the sample average converges almost surely to the expected value. That is
      </a>
      <div class="latex"> Pr(\lim_{n\to+\infty}\overline{X_{n}} = \mu) = 1 </div>
