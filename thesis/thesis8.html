      <h1> Stochastic processes and SDE's </h1>
      <p>
        In probability theory and related fields, a stochastic or <b> random process </b> is a mathematical object,
        usually defined as a sequence of random variables, where the index is usually an interpretation for time.
        Stochastic processes are widely used as mathematical models of systems and phenomena that appear to behave randomly.
        Stochastic processes can be either discrete or continuous regarding to time. In <b> discrete-time </b>, the random variable evolves
        at distinct and particular points in time, while the <b> continuous-time </b> evolves continuously.

        Stochastic processes hold several properties, such as:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li> A stochastic process is said <b> stationary </b> if its statistical properties remain constant over time, such as the mean, variance and correlation structure. </li>
        <li> A stochastic process has the <b> Markov property </b> if the future behavior of the process only depends on its current state, and not on its past history. </li>
        <li> A stochastic process is a <b> martingale </b> if its expected value at any future time, given its current value, is equal to its current value. </li>
        <li> A stochastic process is said to be <b> ergodic </b> if the time average of a random variable converges to the expected value as the time goes to infinity. </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        A <b> stochastic differential equation (SDE) </b> is a differential equation in which one or more of the terms is a stochastic process. In particular, they are differential equations that involve deterministic and random components.
        These are used to model the evolution where randomess plays a significant role. Stochastic differential equations provide a link between probability theory and the much older and more developed fields
        of ordinary and partial differential equations.
        
        The general form of a one-dimensional SDE is the following:

        $$ dX_t = a(t, X_t) dt + b(t, X_t) dW_t $$

        In this model,
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li> \( X_t \) is the process, </li>
        <li> \( a(t, X_t) \) and \( b(t, X_t) \) are deterministc functions, </li>
        <li> \( dW_t \) rapresents the stochastic part, or <b>Brownian motion</b>. </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        In general, SDEs provide a way to describe the evolution of a system over time, being influenced by deterministc functions as well as
        random fluctuations. A stochastic process is the solution for an SDE. However, this is usually simulated, since finding a precise and mathematical
        solution is a very complicated task that requires a lot of time and complex calculations. Some of the most important SDEs are:
      </p>

          <p> <b> Geometric Brownian Motion </b> </p>
          <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;">
            <div style="width: 45%">
              <p> An Geometric Brownian Motion (also known as the exponential Brownian Motion) is a continuous-time stochastic process. In particular, it's used in mathematical finance to model stock prices in a particular financial model.
                This process is best described by its SDE, which is the following:
                $$ dS_{t} = \mu \ S_t \ dt + \sigma \ S_t \ dW_{t} $$
                This ultimately expresses the changes of the Brownian; in particular the process changes by a costant amount every infinitesimal period of time. Formally, the first constant is called <b>drift</b>, while the second is called <b>diffusion term</b>.
                In particular:
              </p>
              
              <ul style="margin-top: 10px;">
                <li> \( S_t \) rapresents the stock prices in a particular time t, </li>
                <li> \(\mu \) is the <b>drift</b>, which is the average rate of return per time unit, </li>
                <li> \( \sigma \) is the <b>volatility</b>, which rapresents the standard deviation of the flactuations, </li>
                <li> \( dW_t \) is a <b>Wiener process</b> (or the Brownian motion), which rapresents the random and continuous movements.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                An Arithmetic Brownian Motion is described by the following SDE:

          <p> <b> Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process </b> </p>
          <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;">

              <p>
                An Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process (also known as the Mean Reverting Process) is a stochastic proces with applications in financial mathematics and physical sciences. Its original application was as a model for the velocity of the Brownian particle
                under a particular friction. Its SDE is the following:
                $$ dX_{t} = \theta (\mu - X_t) dt + \sigma \ dW_{t} $$
                The constant parameters are:
              </p>
              
              <ul style="margin-top: 10px;">
                <li> \( \theta \) which is the rate (or speed) of the mean reversion. It is defined as strictly bigger than 0, </li>
                <li> \( \mu \) is the long term mean of the process. In particular, the process will tend to this particular mean, </li>
                <li> \(  \sigma \) is the <b>volatility</b>. </li>
              </ul>
  
              <p>
                By ignoring the random flactuations (given by the Weiner process), we see that \( X_t \)
                has an overall drift towards the mean value, as expressed above. The process reverts to this mean exponentially, with rate
                \( \theta \). An example is shown on the image on the right:

            A <b> Vasicek Model </b> is a model that fundamentally follows the same same SDE of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process, however the parameter
            \( \theta \) can be a non-constant, in particular it can be a deterministic function of \( t \) (7).
          </p>

          <p>
            A <b> Hull-White Model </b> is an extension of the Vasicek model with the difference that it can be made to fit the current term structure (9). In particular, it's SDE is the following:
            $$ dX_t = [\theta (t) - \mu X_t] dt + \sigma \ dW_t $$
