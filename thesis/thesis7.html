      <h1> "Online" Algorithms (Data Streams): Ideas and code </h1>
      <a>
        A stream of data refers to the continuous arrival of inputs at a very fast rate with limited capacity to store it. Algorithms have to work with such fast data, preferrably in linear time and size. Some methods rely on metric embeddings,
        pseudo-random computations, sparse approzimation theory and communication complexity.
        Some scenarios of data streams include:
      </a>

      <ul>
        <li> <a> Social Media Feeds, such as interactions with photos, posts, comments and other objects in social platform like Instagram, Facebook or others; </a> </li>
        <li> <a> Financial Transactions, such as the continuous flow of money in the stock marker and currency exchange rates; </a> </li>
        <li> <a> IP network traffic analisys, including the flow of packets accross the network infrastructure; </a> </li>
        <li> <a> Sensor data, particularly from IoT devices such as temperature, altitude, pressure and other factors of interest; </a> </li>
        <li> <a> Processing of large data sets. </a> </li>
      </ul>

      <a>
        <b> Online algorithms </b> are designed to work with data as it arrives, instead of waiting for the whole dataset to be available. This is especially important if we are talking about a virtually never ending data set, such as the
        information relied to the algorithm from an IoT sensor.
         Let's condier how to

      <h2> Counting elements in a stream </h2>
      <a>
        In this case we intend to process incrementally counts of occurences. It could be used with a thermal sensor to count the occurences of a particular temperature. A mathematical descriptions is the following:
        Let \( S = [s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4, s_5, ... ] \) be an infinite sequence that rapresents a data stream. In particular, we consider the i-th item to be \( s_i \). We mean to produce a set of items \( I \) defined as
        \( I = \{(x_1, c_1), (x_2, c_2), (x_3, c_3), (x_4, c_4), (x_5, c_5), (x_6, c_6), (x_7, c_7)\} \) where \( x_i \) refers to the value assumed in the infinite series, and \( c_j \) refers to the number of times that item has appeared in the sequence.
        In particular we consider the following rules:
      </a>
      <ul>
        <li> <a> If \( s_i \) is not in I, then \( I' = I \cup \{(s_i, 1)\} \) </a> </li>
        <li> <a> If \( s_i \) is already in I, then \( I' = ( I \setminus \{ (s_i, x_i) \} ) \cup \{(s_i, x_i + 1)\} \) </a> </li>
      </ul>
      <a>
        This is an example of how this behaviour could be achieved with an hashmap:
      </a>

      <pre style="font-family: Menlo, monospace; font-size: large; border-style: solid; width: fit-content; padding-right: 50px; margin-left: 20px;">
        <code>
    function CountStreamElements(stream){
      HashMap hm = new HashMap()

      for each item in stream{
        // I am using the ternary operator to speed up the process.
        hm[item] = (item exists in hm) ? hm[item] + 1 : 1
      }
    }
        </code>
      </pre>
